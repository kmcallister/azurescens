## Implementation details

The feedback happens between two OpenGL textures in a ping-pong fashion. These
have a fixed square size, regardless of the size of the window or screen. It's
determined by the constant `FEEDBACK_TEXTURE_SIZE` in `src/main.rs`.

Each step of the feedback inverts colors, which produces a lot of the
interesting structure. This is why we only render every other step to the
screen; otherwise it would be far too blinky.


## Experimentation and improvement

By default, the shader programs are baked into the azurescens executable at
compile time. This means the executable is self-contained and does not rely on
any external files. If you are playing around with the shaders you should switch
this behavior with a command like

    cargo run --release --features dynamic-shaders

This will read the shaders at runtime, greatly reducing the delay in trying out
new things.

The actual feedback function is implemented in `src/shaders/feedback.glsl`,
which is probably the most interesting file in the whole project. This is a
great place to start experimenting. There are a million different directions
you can go with this basic idea. Pull requests will be accepted, especially if
they add functionality without removing any. (We will need a mode-switching
interface at some point.)

Many ideas for improvement are available in the [issue tracker][issue]. See

Long ago, I made [a similar program][phosphene] in x86-16 assembly which fits
in a master boot record â€” 446 bytes.
